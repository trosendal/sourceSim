* What to do?

We want to simulat data for source attribution and therefore need to
write a tool for someone else to do this. This tool need to simulate
sequence data from 6 alleles with the parameters in the the exsisting
file (calculations.R). 3 Populations (think cattle, sheep and
chickens), a migration matrix to indicate the amount of mixing between
the 'animal' population, Sampling fraction for each animal population
to simulate 'human' cases and the desired number of observations in
the final dataset.


** We want to write a paper

*** TODO write code to run Hald model in R
**** TODO Contact Tine Hald on how to write hald model code
**** TODO Read other paper that have written Hald model in JAGS
*** TODO Start a paper template in Word
**** TODO decide if the mthod we are using for model performance measurement is good enough
