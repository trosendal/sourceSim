## Source attribution simulation
The idea is to use the methods described in this paper:
https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty093 and its accompanying
software: https://bitbucket.org/aleksisipola/bacmeta/src/master/ to
simulate a bacterial population across several artificial partially
overlapping sources and a human population to create simulated dataset
to perform source attribution on. This will be used to test the
efficacy of the existing methods of source attribution for at least
the microbial subtyping methods.
